# Morgan Stanley CodeToGive Asia (Hong Kong/ Singapore) Hackathon 2025

## Project Summary
## Non-profit Mission
Race for Education Accessibilities for Every Child Limited (“REACH”) believes that every child deserves the opportunity to start at the same starting line. There are 230,000 underprivileged children in Hong Kong, one in four of our children live below the poverty line. There are 92,200 families living in subdivided flats in Hong Kong as of the end of 2021. 

Children living in subdivided flats are at an intersection of disadvantages. These children have insufficient home learning support, little to non-English exposure outside the classroom. They are deprived of a quiet and private space to study and often even lack tables to study on. REACH envision a Hong Kong in which every student, regardless of background, gender and ethnicity, is given equal access to resources and opportunities to begin on the same starting line in Primary 1. 
## Challenge Context
Donor engagement is essential for nonprofits like Project Reach because it transforms passive support into active partnership. When donors feel emotionally connected and clearly see the impact of their contributions, they’re more likely to give consistently, advocate for the cause, and become long-term allies. Effective engagement builds trust, fosters transparency, and helps sustain vital programs—especially those serving vulnerable communities like underprivileged K3 students in Hong Kong. 
## Problem Statement
How might we transform one-time donors into engaged community champions through transparent, gamified giving experiences that create lasting psychological connections between donors and the specific campaigns they help?
