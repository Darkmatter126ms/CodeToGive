# Morgan Stanley CodeToGive Asia (Hong Kong/ Singapore) Hackathon 2025

## Project Summary
## Non-profit Mission
Race for Education Accessibilities for Every Child Limited (“REACH”) believes that every child deserves the opportunity to start at the same starting line. There are 230,000 underprivileged children in Hong Kong, one in four of our children live below the poverty line. There are 92,200 families living in subdivided flats in Hong Kong as of the end of 2021. 

Children living in subdivided flats are at an intersection of disadvantages. These children have insufficient home learning support, little to non-English exposure outside the classroom. They are deprived of a quiet and private space to study and often even lack tables to study on. REACH envision a Hong Kong in which every student, regardless of background, gender and ethnicity, is given equal access to resources and opportunities to begin on the same starting line in Primary 1. 
## Challenge Context
Donor engagement is essential for nonprofits like Project Reach because it transforms passive support into active partnership. When donors feel emotionally connected and clearly see the impact of their contributions, they’re more likely to give consistently, advocate for the cause, and become long-term allies. Effective engagement builds trust, fosters transparency, and helps sustain vital programs—especially those serving vulnerable communities like underprivileged K3 students in Hong Kong. 
## Problem Statement
How might we transform one-time donors into engaged community champions through transparent, gamified giving experiences that create lasting psychological connections between donors and the specific campaigns they help?
## Proposed Solution
AI Powered Badges: Serving as a form of collectibles, our AI powered badges gamifies the process of giving for our donors whenever they make a contribution to a particular campaign and serves as a form of recognition for their benevolence as well as establishing a sense of community.

Leaderboard: Inspired by YouTube Star Jimmy Donaldson also more popularly known for his online persona "MrBeast", and Mark Rober, former NASA Engineer, who launced numerous donation drives: Team Trees in 2019, Team Seas in 2021 and Team Water in 2025. Some notable features in the leaderboard includes the overall donations made to the campaign thus far, top all-time donors, as well as most recent donors. This serves as a form of recognition to donors as well for their generosity, promoting friendly competition to drive donations among existing donors, as well as creating a belief to potential new donors that there are people who are helping out for a good cause.

Campaign Newsletter: The database will be queried everyday to check for any donors who are due for a newsletter, containing photos of children and the facilities that are made possible as a result of the funding. This improves transparency of where the funds are going as well as maintaining relationship between donors and project REACH, thus reducing donor attrition.
## Future Implementation
In the interest of time, we would also like to explore the option of recurring donations for donors to improve the longevity of the donation and the Call-to-Action needed for donors to subsequent donations.
